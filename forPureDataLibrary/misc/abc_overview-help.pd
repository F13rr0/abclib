#X text 28 641 The abclib library also provides utility objects for
mixed music: chowning-like panners \, matrices \, envelopes \, an attack
and release detector \, synthesizers (additive \, substractive \, sound
coat \, sound grain \, Risset's bell).;
#X text 27 700 Teaching mixed music at Paris 8 University helped us
in many implementation choices \, thinking of practical requirements
for composers \, to allow them to test their patches either in multichannel
academic studios or at home in simple stereo.;

#X text 31 177 abclib library is the result of 20 years of research
\, teaching and creation in mixed music \, expressed as a set of codes
in Faust language. The main topics addressed are:;
#X text 30 269 It comes as a prolongation of the HOA library developed
by the CICM between 2012 and 2015 which provided an impressive framework
for ambisonics: hoalibrary.mshparisnord.fr;
#X text 29 327 abclib takes over HOA \, proposing a large set of processes
written in Faust language and implemented at various ambisonic orders
(from 1 to 7 \, which means from 3 to 15 parallel instances). It also
puts the emphasis \, outside the scope of ambisonics on multi-channel
sound processing with various dimensions from 1 to 16 parallel instances.
The use of Faust language guarantees software durability and interoperability
between Mac and Windows systems \, as well as Max and PureData softwares.
Faust files are available on a Github repository : https://github.com/alainbonardi/abclib/
;
#X text 28 446 The Faust processes are compiled to Max or PureData
objects. Help patches are also provided as well as some overview patches
or graphic abstractions based on jitter (in Max) or gem libraries (in
PureData). In the field of ambisonics \, 2D objects are provided \,
including general objects (encoders \, decoders \, optimizers \, scopes)
\, geometry objects (maps \, mirrors \, rotates \, specific trajectory
generators) \, and a set of spatial sound processes (decorrelators
\, delays \, granulators \, ring modulators) in both 'syn' and 'fx'
modes. The names of the ambisonic objects in 2D use '2d' as a prefix:
for instance abc_2d_decoder3~ is an ambisonic decoder in 2D at order
3 Multi-channel sound process objects do not use '2d' prefix: for instance
\, abc_delays16 implements a set of 16 parallel delay lines. Multi-channel
sound processors include flangers \, parallel and sequential delays
\, frequency shifters \, harmonizers \, granulators \, reverberations.
